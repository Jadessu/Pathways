# Pathways

...Is an app to track your progress in learning a new skill. It also has social features to help spread encouragement in users learning journey. Users can create "Pathways", which can be seen as a set of skill trees towards learning a subject. Each Pathway has multiple "checkpoints", aka skill trees, and inside each checkpoint there is a checklist of milestones. To give an example, the "Web Development Pathway" will be structured kind of like David's lecture materials in notion. the checkpoints will be "javascript" or "css", etc, and inside each one will have the milestones of skills within that subject. The social features come in as comments on the pathways and checkpoints. Users can leave comments/words of encouragement, and others can like, applaud, agree, etc on the comments.  🛣️
